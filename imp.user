🎓 Project Title:
E-Book Sharing Platform (Admin + User System)

🧠 What You Should Know Before Presenting:
1. ✅ Basic Purpose
“This is a web-based platform where users can register, upload, download, and like PDF e-books. Admins can manage uploaded books and users.”

2. ✅ Key Features to Mention
Feature	Description
User Registration & Login	With password hashing and session management
Role-based Access	Admins vs Regular Users
File Upload	PDF upload with timestamped filenames
File Download	Tracks and updates download count
Like System	One user can like one file only once
Admin Panel	View & delete any file
Secure	Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

3. ✅ Tech Stack
“I built this project using core technologies to understand full-stack development from scratch:”

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Basic styling)

Backend: PHP (Core, no frameworks)

Database: MySQL (Relational + secure)

Tools: XAMPP, phpMyAdmin

4. ✅ Your Role
“I developed this project completely by myself. I designed the database schema, built the frontend forms, handled backend validation, role checks, and also error handling.”

5. ✅ What Makes It Impressive
“Instead of using third-party frameworks, I manually handled file uploads, likes with foreign keys, login sessions, and admin-level controls. This gave me deeper understanding of how systems work behind the scenes.”

💬 Sample Interview Answer (When Asked: "Tell me about your project")
“I built an E-Book Sharing Platform where users can register, upload, download, and like PDF files. I implemented role-based login — so that admins can manage the entire platform including deleting uploaded files. Users can only like each file once, and downloads are tracked. I used PHP and MySQL with session handling, password hashing, and file validation. This helped me understand full-stack development and database relationships.”
